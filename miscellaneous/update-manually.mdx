Chrome automatically updates extensions, but the timing of the update is not clear. If you want to manually update ChatHub to the latest version, here's how to do it:

1. Open the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) in Chrome.
2. Enable the "Developer mode" switch.
3. Click the "Update" button.
