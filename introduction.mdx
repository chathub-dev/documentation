ChatHub is an all-in-one AI client that allows you to use multiple AI chatbots side by side. It supports a wide range of AI models, including ChatGPT/GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini, Llama, and more. With a single input, ChatHub allows you to receive responses from up to six AI chatbots at once.

## Web App

The easiest way to get started with ChatHub is to use the web app. You can access it at [**app.chathub.gg**](https://app.chathub.gg/?utm_source=doc).

Compared to browser extensions, the web app version supports uploading files in multiple formats：
